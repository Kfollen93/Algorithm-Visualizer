# Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
A mini-project visualizing how the Bubble Sort algorithm works. I had spent a couple of weeks going through some LeetCode problems and brushing up on my algorithm knowledge in C#, when I decided that it would be cool (<i>and more fun...</i>) to make it into a project and learn a bit more about the various templates on Visual Studio. I found a series on YouTube by <a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/swpctx> Michael Duffy </a> that I followed along with. This my was first time using Windows Forms and I was surprised to find how easy it was to set up a basic GUI and be able to double click on them to write directly into a function.

### Future Improvements
As of now, I'm content with the project and I do not have plans to continue it. If I were to add more there would be a couple of changes that I would implement. When I first made my Bubble Sort algorithm, I ended up making a recursive resolution (it is commented out in the `BubbleSort.cs` file). It would be fun to implement multiple Bubble Sort solutions and display a test showing the speed/space of each. In addition to this, I would add more sorting algorithms. Lastly, and the part that I struggled with the most, would be to find a way to slow down the program and have it be displayed better to the user on what is happening. The computer sorts the array so fast that it is hard to follow what's happening without some background knowledge of how Bubble Sort already works.
